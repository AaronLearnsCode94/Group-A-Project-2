# Machine Learing Project - Formula One Race Predictor

Group Members - Aaaron Simpson, Paaras Dhaliwal, Cragi Braganza , Gaetano Buongiorno , Luke Evans

## Project Outline

Hypothesis: Predict the outcome of a Grand Prix in the 2022 Formula One Season and analyse different machine learning models to find
an optimal strategy which can be applied for sports betting

Model Summary: Compare different machine learning models such as logistic regression, LSMT and ARIMA to find an optimal model for predicting race outcome and compare the expected returns 

Data Cleanup and Model Training: 

a) Data exploration and cleanup process 

By utlising the Ergast Developer API with F1 race results from 1950-2022, we will utilise only relevant data to individual race outcomes and not "constructor"  championship standings . 


b) Problems that may arise

The main problem that arose was the limitations of the data set

+ Potential misaccuracy of data 

+ Data had no subjective indicators of performance e.g. Cognitive Abilities on Race Day


c) Training processes of interest

3 Models compared against each other: 

-  Logisitic Regression

-  LSMT

- ARIMA


Discussion

a) Findings and results

Post Mortem 


a) Describing difficulties, questions and problems that arose
